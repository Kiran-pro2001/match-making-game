# match-making-game
I created a new game, called  "𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠", in this game, there is a Hit Value, which ranges from 0 to 9, and every time the value of the hit gets changed.  Now the task is to match the hit value to all the options, here options are also changing every time. And there is a time constraint for 60 Seconds.  If you can match it, you will get 10 Points, if not then the game gets ended.
